# ARCahoot-frontend

Frontend for the ARCahoot project.
Serves the website to client, through which they can make a connection to the backend server to play a game.

Hosted by Firebase Hosting for convenience.

## Usage

Find the live site at [https://arcahoot.web.app/](https://arcahoot.web.app/)

To start a local server for testing, run `firebase serve`.

To deploy changes to Firebase Hosting, run `firebase deploy`.

## Development

Make sure you have Firebase CLI installed and Node.js

To get started, run `npm install`. It will install ESLint for you in this repo. Otherwise, this needs no node packages.

Use ESLint to ensure you follow style conventions. Follow the directions in `eslint-setup.md` to set up ESLint.
