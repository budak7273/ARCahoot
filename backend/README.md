# ARCahoot-backend

Backend for the ARCahoot project. Manages connections with clients and runs games. Does not serve website files to client - Firebase hosting does that.

## Usage

To get started, run `npm install`.

To start a server instance, run `npm start`;

## Development

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Use `npm install` to get dependencies. It will also install ESLint for you in this repo.

Currently listens on port 3000 but this could be changed.

Use ESLint to ensure you follow style conventions. Follow the directions in `eslint-setup.md` to set up ESLint.
